# Build Fixes - October 26, 2025

## Summary
Fixed deployment warnings and reduced security vulnerabilities from 20 to 2 (moderate, dev-only).

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Redirect Rule Infinite Loop Warning
**Issue**: `/* /index.html 200` triggered infinite loop detection in Cloudflare Pages.

**Solution**: Added explicit asset handling before SPA fallback:
```
/assets/* /assets/:splat 200
/* /index.html 200
```

**Files Modified**:
- `public/_redirects`
- `dist/_redirects`

### 2. Removed Unused Dependencies with Security Vulnerabilities
**Issue**: 20 security vulnerabilities (3 low, 2 moderate, 12 high, 3 critical)

**Solution**: Removed `react-snap` (unused, deprecated, source of 18 vulnerabilities)

**Result**: 
- Removed 132 packages
- **90% reduction** in vulnerabilities (20 → 2)
- All critical/high vulnerabilities eliminated

### 3. Remaining Vulnerabilities (Acceptable)
**2 Moderate Vulnerabilities** in esbuild/vite:
- **CVE**: GHSA-67mh-4wv8-2f99
- **Severity**: Moderate
- **Scope**: Dev server only (not production)
- **Fix**: Requires Vite v5 → v7 (breaking change)
- **Decision**: Acceptable risk - dev-only, project builds successfully

## Build Verification

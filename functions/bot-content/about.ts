    </ul>

    <h2>üéØ Our Strategy: Real-World Data, Real Solutions</h2>
    
    <h3>1. Real-World Data Foundation</h3>
    <p><strong>Collecting actual maintenance events, failures, and conditions from operating vessels</strong></p>
    <p>Building a global knowledge base of maritime equipment behavior:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Actual failure patterns:</strong> Not theoretical models, but real operational data</li>
      <li><strong>Condition-based insights:</strong> From real vessel operations in diverse conditions</li>
      <li><strong>Maintenance effectiveness tracking:</strong> What works and what doesn't</li>
      <li><strong>Equipment lifecycle data:</strong> Performance across entire service life</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>2. Intelligent Pattern Recognition</h3>
    <p><strong>Using advanced analytics to correlate maintenance outcomes</strong></p>
    <p>Understanding relationships between:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Predictive failure analysis:</strong> Identifying early warning signs</li>
      <li><strong>Optimal maintenance timing:</strong> When to service for best results</li>
      <li><strong>Cost-benefit optimization:</strong> Balancing maintenance costs vs failure risks</li>
      <li><strong>Risk-based prioritization:</strong> Focus on highest-impact maintenance</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3. Continuous Learning System</h3>
    <p><strong>Every maintenance event feeds back into the system</strong></p>
    <p>Making predictions more accurate over time:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Self-improving accuracy:</strong> Learns from every maintenance outcome</li>
      <li><strong>Fleet-wide knowledge sharing:</strong> One vessel's experience benefits entire fleet</li>
      <li><strong>Adaptive to new equipment:</strong> Quickly learns behavior of new systems</li>
      <li><strong>Industry benchmark insights:</strong> Performance comparison across maritime sector</li>
    </ul>
